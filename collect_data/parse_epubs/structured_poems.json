    "ADVERTISEMENT.": "It is the honourable characteristic of Poetry that its materials are to be found in every subject which can interest the human mind. The evidence of this fact is to be sought, not in the writings of Critics, but in those of Poets themselves. The majority of the following poems are to be considered as experiments. They were written chiefly with a view to ascertain how far the language of conversation in the middle and lower classes of society is adapted to the purposes of poetic pleasure. Readers accustomed to the gaudiness and inane phraseology of many modern writers, if they persist in reading this book to its conclusion, will perhaps frequently have to struggle with feelings of strangeness and aukwardness: they will look round for poetry, and will be induced to enquire by what species of courtesy these attempts can be permitted to assume that title. It is desirable that such readers, for their own sakes, should not suffer the solitary word Poetry, a word of very disputed meaning, to stand in the way of their gratification; but that, while they are perusing this book, they should ask themselves if it contains a natural delineation of human passions, human characters, and human incidents; and if the answer be favourable to the author\u2019s wishes, that they should consent to be pleased in spite of that most dreadful enemy to our pleasures, our own pre-established codes of decision. Readers of superior judgment may disapprove of the style in which many of these pieces are executed it must be expected that many lines and phrases will not exactly suit their taste. It will perhaps appear to them, that wishing to avoid the prevalent fault of the day, the author has sometimes descended too low, and that many of his expressions are too familiar, and not of sufficient dignity. It is apprehended, that the more conversant the reader is with our elder writers, and with those in modern times who have been the most successful in painting manners and passions, the fewer complaints of this kind will he have to make. An accurate taste in poetry, and in all the other arts, Sir Joshua Reynolds has observed, is an acquired talent, which can only be produced by severe thought, and a long continued intercourse with the best models of composition. This is mentioned not with so ridiculous a purpose as to prevent the most inexperienced reader from judging for himself; but merely to temper the rashness of decision, and to suggest that if poetry be a subject on which much time has not been bestowed, the judgment may be erroneous, and that in many cases it necessarily will be so. The tale of Goody Blake and Harry Gill is founded on a well-authenticated fact which happened in Warwickshire. Of the other poems in the collection, it may be proper to say that they are either absolute inventions of the author, or facts which took place within his personal observation or that of his friends. The poem of the Thorn, as the reader will soon discover, is not supposed to be spoken in the author\u2019s own person: the character of the loquacious narrator will sufficiently shew itself in the course of the story. The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere was professedly written in imitation of thestyle, as well as of the spirit of the elder poets; but with a few exceptions, the Author believes that the language adopted in it has been equally intelligible for these three last centuries. The lines entitled Expostulation and Reply, and those which follow, arose out of conversation with a friend who was somewhat unreasonably attached to modern books of moral philosophy.",

    "THE FOSTER-MOTHER\u2019S TALE, A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT.": "FOSTER-MOTHER.I never saw the man whom you describe.MARIA.\u2019Tis strange! he spake of you familiarlyAs mine and Albert\u2019s common Foster-mother.FOSTER-MOTHER.Now blessings on the man, whoe\u2019er he be,That joined your names with mine! O my sweet lady,As often as I think of those dear timesWhen you two little ones would stand at eveOn each side of my chair, and make me learnAll you had learnt in the day; and how to talkIn gentle phrase, then bid me sing to you\u2014\u2019Tis more like heaven to come than whathasbeen.MARIA.O my dear Mother! this strange man has left meTroubled with wilder fancies, than the moonBreeds in the love-sick maid who gazes at it,Till lost in inward vision, with wet eyeShe gazes idly!\u2014But that entrance, Mother!FOSTER-MOTHER.Can no one hear? It is a perilous tale!MARIA.No one.FOSTER-MOTHERMy husband\u2019s father told it me,Poor old Leoni!\u2014Angels rest his soul!He was a woodman, and could fell and sawWith lusty arm. You know that huge round beamWhich props the hanging wall of the old chapel?Beneath that tree, while yet it was a treeHe found a baby wrapt in mosses, linedWith thistle-beards, and such small locks of woolAs hang on brambles. Well, he brought him home,And reared him at the then Lord Velez\u2019 cost.And so the babe grew up a pretty boy,A pretty boy, but most unteachable\u2014And never learnt a prayer, nor told a bead,But knew the names of birds, and mocked their notes,And whistled, as he were a bird himself:And all the autumn \u2019twas his only playTo get the seeds of wild flowers, and to plant themWith earth and water, on the stumps of trees.A Friar, who gathered simples in the wood,A grey-haired man\u2014he loved this little boy,The boy loved him\u2014and, when the Friar taught him,He soon could write with the pen: and from that time,Lived chiefly at the Convent or the Castle.So he became a very learned youth.But Oh! poor wretch!\u2014he read, and read, and read,\u2019Till his brain turned\u2014and ere his twentieth year,He had unlawful thoughts of many things:And though he prayed, he never loved to prayWith holy men, nor in a holy place\u2014But yet his speech, it was so soft and sweet,The late Lord Velez ne\u2019er was wearied with him.And once, as by the north side of the ChapelThey stood together, chained in deep discourse,The earth heaved under them with such a groan,That the wall tottered, and had well-nigh fallenRight on their heads. My Lord was sorely frightened;A fever seized him, and he made confessionOf all the heretical and lawless talkWhich brought this judgment: so the youth was seizedAnd cast into that hole. My husband\u2019s fatherSobbed like a child\u2014it almost broke his heart:And once as he was working in the cellar,He heard a voice distinctly; \u2019twas the youth\u2019s,Who sung a doleful song about green fields,How sweet it were on lake or wild savannah,To hunt for food, and be a naked man,And wander up and down at liberty.He always doted on the youth, and nowHis love grew desperate; and defying death,He made that cunning entrance I described:And the young man escaped.MARIA.\u2019Tis a sweet tale:Such as would lull a listening child to sleep,His rosy face besoiled with unwiped tears.\u2014And what became of him?FOSTER-MOTHER.He went on ship-boardWith those bold voyagers, who made discoveryOf golden lands. Leoni\u2019s younger brotherWent likewise, and when he returned to Spain,He told Leoni, that the poor mad youth,Soon after they arrived in that new world,In spite of his dissuasion, seized a boat,And all alone, set sail by silent moonlightUp a great river, great as any sea,And ne\u2019er was heard of more: but \u2019tis supposed,He lived and died among the savage men.",
    "LINES LEFT UPON A SEAT IN A YEW-TREE WHICH STANDS NEAR THE LAKE OF ESTHWAITE, ON A DESOLATE PART OF THE SHORE, YET COMMANDING A BEAUTIFUL PROSPECT.": "\u2014Nay, Traveller! rest. This lonely yew-tree standsFar from all human dwelling: what if hereNo sparkling rivulet spread the verdant herb;What if these barren boughs the bee not loves;Yet, if the wind breathe soft, the curling waves,That break against the shore, shall lull thy mindBy one soft impulse saved from vacancy.\u2014Who he wasThat piled these stones, and with the mossy sodFirst covered o\u2019er, and taught this aged tree,Now wild, to bend its arms in circling shade,I well remember.\u2014He was one who own\u2019dNo common soul. In youth, by genius nurs\u2019d,And big with lofty views, he to the worldWent forth, pure in his heart, against the taintOf dissolute tongues, \u2019gainst jealousy, and hate,And scorn, against all enemies prepared,All but neglect: and so, his spirit dampedAt once, with rash disdain he turned away,And with the food of pride sustained his soulIn solitude.\u2014Stranger! these gloomy boughsHad charms for him; and here he loved to sit,His only visitants a straggling sheep,The stone-chat, or the glancing sand-piper;And on these barren rocks, with juniper,And heath, and thistle, thinly sprinkled o\u2019er,Fixing his downward eye, he many an hourA morbid pleasure nourished, tracing hereAn emblem of his own unfruitful life:And lifting up his head, he then would gazeOn the more distant scene; how lovely \u2019tisThou seest, and he would gaze till it becameFar lovelier, and his heart could not sustainThe beauty still more beauteous. Nor, that time,Would he forget those beings, to whose minds,Warm from the labours of benevolence,The world, and man himself, appeared a sceneOf kindred loveliness: then he would sighWith mournful joy, to think that others feltWhat he must never feel: and so, lost man!On visionary views would fancy feed,Till his eye streamed with tears. In this deep valeHe died, this seat his only monument.If thou be one whose heart the holy formsOf young imagination have kept pure,Stranger! henceforth be warned; and know, that pride,Howe\u2019er disguised in its own majesty,Is littleness; that he, who feels contemptFor any living thing, hath facultiesWhich he has never used; that thought with himIs in its infancy. The man, whose eyeIs ever on himself, doth look on one,The least of nature\u2019s works, one who might moveThe wise man to that scorn which wisdom holdsUnlawful, ever. O, be wiser thou!Instructed that true knowledge leads to love,True dignity abides with him aloneWho, in the silent hour of inward thought,Can still suspect, and still revere himself,In lowliness of heart.",
    "THE FEMALE VAGRANT.": "By Derwent\u2019s side my Father\u2019s cottage stood,(The Woman thus her artless story told)One field, a flock, and what the neighbouring floodSupplied, to him were more than mines of gold.Light was my sleep; my days in transport roll\u2019d:With thoughtless joy I stretch\u2019d along the shoreMy father\u2019s nets, or watched, when from the foldHigh o\u2019er the cliffs I led my fleecy store,A dizzy depth below! his boat and twinkling oar.My father was a good and pious man,An honest man by honest parents bred,And I believe that, soon as I beganTo lisp, he made me kneel beside my bed,And in his hearing there my prayers I said:And afterwards, by my good father taught,I read, and loved the books in which I read;For books in every neighbouring house I sought,And nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought.Can I forget what charms did once adornMy garden, stored with pease, and mint, and thyme,And rose and lilly for the sabbath morn?The sabbath bells, and their delightful chime;The gambols and wild freaks at shearing time;My hen\u2019s rich nest through long grass scarce espied;The cowslip-gathering at May\u2019s dewy prime;The swans, that, when I sought the water-side,From far to meet me came, spreading their snowy pride.The staff I yet remember which upboreThe bending body of my active sire;His seat beneath the honeyed sycamoreWhen the bees hummed, and chair by winter fire;When market-morning came, the neat attireWith which, though bent on haste, myself I deck\u2019d;My watchful dog, whose starts of furious ire,When stranger passed, so often I have check\u2019d;The red-breast known for years, which at my casement peck\u2019d.The suns of twenty summers danced along,\u2014Ah! little marked, how fast they rolled away:Then rose a mansion proud our woods among,And cottage after cottage owned its sway,No joy to see a neighbouring house, or strayThrough pastures not his own, the master took;My Father dared his greedy wish gainsay;He loved his old hereditary nook,And ill could I the thought of such sad parting brook.But, when he had refused the proffered gold,To cruel injuries he became a prey,Sore traversed in whate\u2019er he bought and sold:His troubles grew upon him day by day,Till all his substance fell into decay.His little range of water was denied;2All but the bed where his old body lay,All, all was seized, and weeping, side by side,We sought a home where we uninjured might abide.Can I forget that miserable hour,When from the last hill-top, my sire surveyed,Peering above the trees, the steeple tower,That on his marriage-day sweet music made?Till then he hoped his bones might there be laid,Close by my mother in their native bowers:Bidding me trust in God, he stood and prayed,\u2014I could not pray:\u2014through tears that fell in showers,Glimmer\u2019d our dear-loved home, alas! no longer ours!There was a youth whom I had loved so long,That when I loved him not I cannot say.\u2019Mid the green mountains many and many a songWe two had sung, like little birds in May.When we began to tire of childish playWe seemed still more and more to prize each other:We talked of marriage and our marriage day;And I in truth did love him like a brother,For never could I hope to meet with such another.His father said, that to a distant townHe must repair, to ply the artist\u2019s trade.What tears of bitter grief till then unknown!What tender vows our last sad kiss delayed!To him we turned:\u2014we had no other aid.Like one revived, upon his neck I wept,And her whom he had loved in joy, he saidHe well could love in grief: his faith he kept;And in a quiet home once more my father slept.Four years each day with daily bread was blest,By constant toil and constant prayer supplied.Three lovely infants lay upon my breast;And often, viewing their sweet smiles, I sighed,And knew not why. My happy father diedWhen sad distress reduced the children\u2019s meal:Thrice happy! that from him the grave did hideThe empty loom, cold hearth, and silent wheel,And tears that flowed for ills which patience could not heal.\u2019Twas a hard change, an evil time was come;We had no hope, and no relief could gain.But soon, with proud parade, the noisy drumBeat round, to sweep the streets of want and pain.My husband\u2019s arms now only served to strainMe and his children hungering in his view:In such dismay my prayers and tears were vain:To join those miserable men he flew;And now to the sea-coast, with numbers more, we drew.There foul neglect for months and months we bore,Nor yet the crowded fleet its anchor stirred.Green fields before us and our native shore,By fever, from polluted air incurred,Ravage was made, for which no knell was heard.Fondly we wished, and wished away, nor knew,\u2019Mid that long sickness, and those hopes deferr\u2019d,That happier days we never more must view:The parting signal streamed, at last the land withdrew,But from delay the summer calms were past.On as we drove, the equinoctial deepRan mountains\u2014high before the howling blaft.We gazed with terror on the gloomy sleepOf them that perished in the whirlwind\u2019s sweep,Untaught that soon such anguish must ensue,Our hopes such harvest of affliction reap,That we the mercy of the waves should rue.We reached the western world, a poor, devoted crew.Oh! dreadful price of being to resignAll that is dearinbeing! better farIn Want\u2019s most lonely cave till death to pine,Unseen, unheard, unwatched by any star;Or in the streets and walks where proud men are,Better our dying bodies to obtrude,Than dog-like, wading at the heels of war,Protract a curst existence, with the broodThat lap (their very nourishment!) their brother\u2019s blood.The pains and plagues that on our heads came down,Disease and famine, agony and fear,In wood or wilderness, in camp or town,It would thy brain unsettle even to hear.All perished\u2014all, in one remorseless year,Husband and children! one by one, by swordAnd ravenous plague, all perished: every tearDried up, despairing, desolate, on boardA British ship I waked, as from a trance restored.Peaceful as some immeasurable plainBy the first beams of dawning light impress\u2019d,In the calm sunshine slept the glittering main.The very ocean has its hour of rest,That comes not to the human mourner\u2019s breast.Remote from man, and storms of mortal care,A heavenly silence did the waves invest;I looked and looked along the silent air,Until it seemed to bring a joy to my despair.Ah! how unlike those late terrific sleeps!And groans, that rage of racking famine spoke,Where looks inhuman dwelt on festering heaps!The breathing pestilence that rose like smoke!The shriek that from the distant battle broke!The mine\u2019s dire earthquake, and the pallid hostDriven by the bomb\u2019s incessant thunder-strokeTo loathsome vaults, where heart-sick anguish toss\u2019d,Hope died, and fear itself in agony was lost!Yet does that burst of woe congeal my frame,When the dark streets appeared to heave and gape,While like a sea the storming army came,And Fire from Hell reared his gigantic shape,And Murder, by the ghastly gleam, and RapeSeized their joint prey, the mother and the child!But from these crazing thoughts my brain, escape!\u2014For weeks the balmy air breathed soft and mild,And on the gliding vessel Heaven and Ocean smiled.Some mighty gulph of separation past,I seemed transported to another world:\u2014A thought resigned with pain, when from the mastThe impatient mariner the sail unfurl\u2019d,And whistling, called the wind that hardly curledThe silent sea. From the sweet thoughts of home,And from all hope I was forever hurled.For me\u2014farthest from earthly port to roamWas best, could I but shun the spot where man might come.And oft, robb\u2019d of my perfect mind, I thoughtAt last my feet a resting-place had found:Here will I weep in peace, (so fancy wrought,)Roaming the illimitable waters round;Here watch, of every human friend disowned,All day, my ready tomb the ocean-flood\u2014To break my dream the vessel reached its bound:And homeless near a thousand homes I stood,And near a thousand tables pined, and wanted food.By grief enfeebled was I turned adrift,Helpless as sailor cast on desart rock;Nor morsel to my mouth that day did lift,Nor dared my hand at any door to knock.I lay, where with his drowsy mates, the cockFrom the cross timber of an out-house hung;How dismal tolled, that night, the city clock!At morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung,Nor to the beggar\u2019s language could I frame my tongue.So passed another day, and so the third:Then did I try, in vain, the crowd\u2019s resort,In deep despair by frightful wishes stirr\u2019d,Near the sea-side I reached a ruined fort:There, pains which nature could no more support,With blindness linked, did on my vitals fall;Dizzy my brain, with interruption shortOf hideous sense; I sunk, nor step could crawl,And thence was borne away to neighbouring hospital.Recovery came with food: but still, my brainWas weak, nor of the past had memory.I heard my neighbours, in their beds, complainOf many things which never troubled me;Of feet still bustling round with busy glee,Of looks where common kindness had no part,Of service done with careless cruelty,Fretting the fever round the languid heart,And groans, which, as they said, would make a dead man start.These things just served to stir the torpid sense,Nor pain nor pity in my bosom raised.Memory, though slow, returned with strength; and thenceDismissed, again on open day I gazed,At houses, men, and common light, amazed.The lanes I sought, and as the sun retired,Came, where beneath the trees a faggot blazed;The wild brood saw me weep, my fate enquired,And gave me food, and rest, more welcome, more desired.My heart is touched to think that men like these,The rude earth\u2019s tenants, were my first relief:How kindly did they paint their vagrant ease!And their long holiday that feared not grief,For all belonged to all, and each was chief.No plough their sinews strained; on grating roadNo wain they drove, and yet, the yellow sheafIn every vale for their delight was stowed:For them, in nature\u2019s meads, the milky udder flowed.Semblance, with straw and pauniered ass, they madeOf potters wandering on from door to door:But life of happier sort to me pourtrayed,And other joys my fancy to allure;The bag-pipe dinning on the midnight moorIn barn uplighted, and companions boonWell met from far with revelry secure,In depth of forest glade, when jocund JuneRolled fast along the sky his warm and genial moon.But ill it suited me, in journey darkO\u2019er moor and mountain, midnight theft to hatch;To charm the surly house-dog\u2019s faithful bark.Or hang on tiptoe at the lifted latch;The gloomy lantern, and the dim blue match,The black disguise, the warning whistle shrill,And ear still busy on its nightly watch,Were not for me, brought up in nothing ill;Besides, on griefs so fresh my thoughts were brooding still.What could I do, unaided and unblest?Poor Father! gone was every friend of thine:And kindred of dead husband are at bestSmall help, and, after marriage such as mine,With little kindness would to me incline.Ill was I then for toil or service fit:With tears whose course no effort could confine,By high-way side forgetful would I sitWhole hours, my idle arms in moping sorrow knit.I lived upon the mercy of the fields,And oft of cruelty the sky accused;On hazard, or what general bounty yields,Now coldly given, now utterly refused,The fields I for my bed have often used:But, what afflicts my peace with keenest ruthIs, that I have my inner self abused,Foregone the home delight of constant truth,And clear and open soul, so prized in fearless youth.Three years a wanderer, often have I view\u2019d,In tears, the sun towards that country tendWhere my poor heart lost all its fortitude:And now across this moor my steps I bend\u2014Oh! tell me whither\u2014for no earthly friendHave I.\u2014She ceased, and weeping turned away,As if because her tale was at an endShe wept;\u2014because she had no more to sayOf that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay.

    "GOODY BLAKE, AND HARRY GILL, A TRUE STORY.": "Oh! what\u2019s the matter? what\u2019s the matter?What is\u2019t that ails young Harry Gill?That evermore his teeth they chatter,Chatter, chatter, chatter still.Of waistcoats Harry has no lack,Good duffle grey, and flannel fine;He has a blanket on his back,And coats enough to smother nine.In March, December, and in July,\u201cTis all the same with Harry Gill;The neighbours tell, and tell you truly,His teeth they chatter, chatter still.At night, at morning, and at noon,\u2019Tis all the same with Harry Gill;Beneath the sun, beneath the moon,His teeth they chatter, chatter still.Young Harry was a lusty drover,And who so stout of limb as he?His cheeks were red as ruddy clover,His voice was like the voice of three.Auld Goody Blake was old and poor,Ill fedd she was, and thinly clad;And any man who pass\u2019d her door,Might see how poor a hut she had.All day she spun in her poor dwelling,And then her three hours\u2019 work at night!Alas! \u2019twas hardly worth the telling,It would not pay for candle-light.\u2014This woman dwelt in Dorsetshire,Her hut was on a cold hill-side,And in that country coals are dear,For they come far by wind and tide.By the same fire to boil their pottage,Two poor old dames, as I have known,Will often live in one small cottage,But she, poor woman, dwelt alone.\u2019Twas well enough when summer came,The long, warm, lightsome summer-day,Then at her door thecantydameWould sit, as any linnet gay.But when the ice our streams did fetter,Oh! then how her old bones would shake!You would have said, if you had met her,\u2019Twas a hard time for Goody Blake.Her evenings then were dull and dead;Sad case it was, as you may think,For very cold to go to bed,And then for cold not sleep a wink.Oh joy for her! when e\u2019er in winterThe winds at night had made a rout,And scatter\u2019d many a lusty splinter,And many a rotten bough about.Yet never had she, well or sick,As every man who knew her says,A pile before-hand, wood or stick,Enough to warm her for three days.Now, when the frost was past enduring,And made her poor old bones to ache,Could any thing be more alluring,Than an old hedge to Goody Blake?And now and then, it must be said,When her old bones were cold and chill,She left her fire, or left her bed,To seek the hedge of Harry Gill.Now Harry he had long suspectedThis trespass of old Goody Blake,And vow\u2019d that she should be detected,And he on her would vengeance take.And oft from his warm fire he\u2019d go,And to the fields his road would take,And there, at night, in frost and snow,He watch\u2019d to seize old Goody Blake.And once, behind a rick of barley,Thus looking out did Harry stand;The moon was full and shining clearly,And crisp with frost the stubble-land.\u2014He hears a noise\u2014he\u2019s all awake\u2014Again?\u2014on tip-toe down the hillHe softly creeps\u2014\u2019Tis Goody Blake,She\u2019s at the hedge of Harry Gill.Right glad was he when he beheld her:Stick after stick did Goody pull,He stood behind a bush of elder,Till she had filled her apron full.When with her load she turned about,The bye-road back again to take,He started forward with a shout,And sprang upon poor Goody Blake.And fiercely by the arm he took her,And by the arm he held her fast,And fiercely by the arm he shook her,And cried, \u201cI\u2019ve caught you then at last!\u201dThen Goody, who had nothing said,Her bundle from her lap let fall;And kneeling on the sticks, she pray\u2019dTo God that is the judge of all.She pray\u2019d, her wither\u2019d hand uprearing,While Harry held her by the arm\u2014\u201cGod! who art never out of hearing,\u201cO may he never more be warm!\u201dThe cold, cold moon above her head,Thus on her knees did Goody pray,Young Harry heard what she had said,And icy-cold he turned away.He went complaining all the morrowThat he was cold and very chill:His face was gloom, his heart was sorrow,Alas! that day for Harry Gill!That day he wore a riding-coat,But not a whit the warmer he:Another was on Thursday brought,And ere the Sabbath he had three.\u2019Twas all in vain, a useless matter,And blankets were about him pinn\u2019d;Yet still his jaws and teeth they clatter,Like a loose casement in the wind.And Harry\u2019s flesh it fell away;And all who see him say \u2019tis plain,That, live as long as live he may,He never will be warm again.No word to any man he utters,A-bed or up, to young or old;But ever to himself he mutters,\u201cPoor Harry Gill is very cold.\u201dA-bed or up, by night or day;His teeth they chatter, chatter still.Now think, ye farmers all, I pray,Of Goody Blake and Harry Gill.",

(\u2019tis a wish of mine)Now that our morning meal is done,Make haste, your morning task resign;Come forth and feel the sun.Edward will come with you, and pray,Put on with speed your woodland dress,And bring no book, for this one dayWe\u2019ll give to idleness.No joyless forms shall regulateOur living Calendar:We from to-day, my friend, will dateThe opening of the year.Love, now an universal birth.From heart to heart is stealing,From earth to man, from man to earth,\u2014It is the hour of feeling.One moment now may give us moreThan fifty years of reason;Our minds shall drink at every poreThe spirit of the season.Some silent laws our hearts may make,Which they shall long obey;We for the year to come may takeOur temper from to-day.And from the blessed power that rollsAbout, below, above;We\u2019ll frame the measure of our souls,They shall be tuned to love.Then come, my sister! come, I pray,With speed put on your woodland dress,And bring no book; for this one dayWe\u2019ll give to idleness.",
    "SIMON LEE, THE OLD HUNTSMAN, WITH AN INCIDENT IN WHICH HE WAS CONCERNED.": "In the sweet shire of Cardigan,Not far from pleasant Ivor-hall,An old man dwells, a little man,I\u2019ve heard he once was tall.Of years he has upon his back,No doubt, a burthen weighty;He says he is three score and ten,But others say he\u2019s eighty.A long blue livery-coat has he,That\u2019s fair behind, and fair before;Yet, meet him where you will, you seeAt once that he is poor.Full five and twenty years he livedA running huntsman merry;And, though he has but one eye left,His cheek is like a cherry.No man like him the horn could sound.And no man was so full of glee;To say the least, four counties roundHad heard of Simon Lee;His master\u2019s dead, and no one nowDwells in the hall of Ivor;Men, dogs, and horses, all are dead;He is the sole survivor.His hunting feats have him bereftOf his right eye, as you may see:And then, what limbs those feats have leftTo poor old Simon Lee!He has no son, he has no child,His wife, an aged woman,Lives with him, near the waterfall,Upon the village common.And he is lean and he is sick,His little body\u2019s half awryHis ancles they are swoln and thickHis legs are thin and dry.When he was young he little knewOf husbandry or tillage;And now he\u2019s forced to work, though weak,\u2014The weakest in the village.He all the country could outrun,Could leave both man and horse behind;And often, ere the race was done,He reeled and was stone-blind.And still there\u2019s something in the worldAt which his heart rejoices;For when the chiming hounds are out,He dearly loves their voices!Old Ruth works out of doors with him,And does what Simon cannot do;For she, not over stout of limb,Is stouter of the two.And though you with your utmost skillFrom labour could not wean them,Alas! \u2019tis very little, allWhich they can do between them.Beside their moss-grown hut of clay,Not twenty paces from the door,A scrap of land they have, but theyAre poorest of the poor.This scrap of land he from the heathEnclosed when he was stronger;But what avails the land to them,Which they can till no longer?Few months of life has he in store,As he to you will tell,For still, the more he works, the moreHis poor old ancles swell.My gentle reader, I perceiveHow patiently you\u2019ve waited,And I\u2019m afraid that you expectSome tale will be related.O reader! had you in your mindSuch stores as silent thought can bring,O gentle reader! you would findA tale in every thing.What more I have to say is short,I hope you\u2019ll kindly take it;It is no tale; but should you think,Perhaps a tale you\u2019ll make it.One summer-day I chanced to seeThis old man doing all he couldAbout the root of an old tree,A stump of rotten wood.The mattock totter\u2019d in his hand;So vain was his endeavourThat at the root of the old treeHe might have worked for ever.\u201cYou\u2019re overtasked, good Simon Lee,Give me your tool\u201d to him I said;And at the word right gladly heReceived my proffer\u2019d aid.I struck, and with a single blowThe tangled root I sever\u2019d,At which the poor old man so longAnd vainly had endeavour\u2019d.The tears into his eyes were brought,And thanks and praises seemed to runSo fast out of his heart, I thoughtThey never would have done.\u2014I\u2019ve heard of hearts unkind, kind deedsWith coldness still returning.Alas! the gratitude of menHas oftner left me mourning.",
    "ANECDOTE FOR FATHERS SHEWING HOW THE ART OF LYING MAY BE TAUGHT.": "I have a boy of five years old,His face is fair and fresh to see;His limbs are cast in beauty\u2019s mould,And dearly he loves me.One morn we stroll\u2019d on our dry walk,Our quiet house all full in view,And held such intermitted talkAs we are wont to do.My thoughts on former pleasures ran;I thought of Kilve\u2019s delightful shore,My pleasant home, when spring began,A long, long year before.A day it was when I could bearTo think, and think, and think again;With so much happiness to spare,I could not feel a pain.My boy was by my side, so slimAnd graceful in his rustic dress!And oftentimes I talked to him,In very idleness.The young lambs ran a pretty race;The morning sun shone bright and warm;\u201cKilve,\u201d said I, \u201cwas a pleasant place,\u201cAnd so is Liswyn farm.\u201cMy little boy, which like you more,\u201dI said and took him by the arm\u2014\u201cOur home by Kilve\u2019s delightful shore,\u201cOr here at Liswyn farm?\u201d\u201cAnd tell me, had you rather be,\u201dI said and held him by the arm,\u201cAt Kilve\u2019s smooth shore by the green sea,\u201cOr here at Liswyn farm?\u201dIn careless mood he looked at me,While still I held him by the arm,And said, \u201cAt Kilve I\u2019d rather be\u201cThan here at Liswyn farm.\u201d\u201cNow, little Edward, say why so;My little Edward, tell me why;\u201d\u201cI cannot tell, I do not know,\u201d\u201cWhy this is strange,\u201d said I.\u201cFor, here are woods and green-hills warm;\u201cThere surely must some reason be\u201cWhy you would change sweet Liswyn farm\u201cFor Kilve by the green sea.\u201dAt this, my boy, so fair and slim,Hung down his head, nor made reply;And five times did I say to him,\u201cWhy? Edward, tell me why?\u201dHis head he raised\u2014there was in sight,It caught his eye, he saw it plain\u2014Upon the house-top, glittering bright,A broad and gilded vane.Then did the boy his tongue unlock,And thus to me he made reply;\u201cAt Kilve there was no weather-cock,\u201cAnd that\u2019s the reason why.\u201dOh dearest, dearest boy! my heartFor better lore would seldom yearn,Could I but teach the hundredth partOf what from thee I learn.",
    "WE ARE SEVEN.": "A simple child, dear brother Jim,That lightly draws its breath,And feels its life in every limb,What should it know of death?I met a little cottage girl,She was eight years old, she said;Her hair was thick with many a curlThat cluster\u2019d round her head.She had a rustic, woodland air,And she was wildly clad;Her eyes were fair, and very fair,\u2014Her beauty made me glad.\u201cSisters and brothers, little maid,\u201cHow many may you be?\u201d\u201cHow many? seven in all,\u201d she said,And wondering looked at me.\u201cAnd where are they, I pray you tell?\u201dShe answered, \u201cSeven are we,\u201cAnd two of us at Conway dwell,\u201cAnd two are gone to sea.\u201cTwo of us in the church-yard lie,\u201cMy sister and my brother,\u201cAnd in the church-yard cottage, I\u201cDwell near them with my mother.\u201d\u201cYou say that two at Conway dwell,\u201cAnd two are gone to sea,\u201cYet you are seven; I pray you tell\u201cSweet Maid, how this may be?\u201dThen did the little Maid reply,\u201cSeven boys and girls are we;\u201cTwo of us in the church-yard lie,\u201cBeneath the church-yard tree.\u201d\u201cYou run about, my little maid,\u201cYour limbs they are alive;\u201cIf two are in the church-yard laid,\u201cThen ye are only five.\u201d\u201cTheir graves are green, they may be seen,\u201dThe little Maid replied,\u201cTwelve steps or more from my mother\u2019s door,\u201cAnd they are side by side.\u201cMy stockings there I often knit,\u201cMy \u2019kerchief there I hem;\u201cAnd there upon the ground I sit\u2014\u201cI sit and sing to them.\u201cAnd often after sunset, Sir,\u201cWhen it is light and fair,\u201cI take my little porringer,\u201cAnd eat my supper there.\u201cThe first that died was little Jane;\u201cIn bed she moaning lay,\u201cTill God released her of her pain,\u201cAnd then she went away.\u201cSo in the church-yard she was laid,\u201cAnd all the summer dry,\u201cTogether round her grave we played,\u201cMy brother John and I.\u201cAnd when the ground was white with snow,\u201cAnd I could run and slide,\u201cMy brother John was forced to go,\u201cAnd he lies by her side.\u201d\u201cHow many are you then,\u201d said I,\u201cIf they two are in Heaven?\u201dThe little Maiden did reply,\u201cO Master! we are seven.\u201d\u201cBut they are dead; those two are dead!\u201cTheir spirits are in heaven!\u201d\u2019Twas throwing words away; for stillThe little Maid would have her will,And said, \u201cNay, we are seven!\u201d",
    "LINES WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING.": "I heard a thousand blended notes,While in a grove I sate reclined,In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughtsBring sad thoughts to the mind.To her fair works did nature linkThe human soul that through me ran;And much it griev\u2019d my heart to thinkWhat man has made of man.Through primrose-tufts, in that sweet bower,The periwinkle trail\u2019d its wreathes;And \u2019tis my faith that every flowerEnjoys the air it breathes.The birds around me hopp\u2019d and play\u2019d:Their thoughts I cannot measure,But the least motion which they made,It seem\u2019d a thrill of pleasure.The budding twigs spread out their fan,To catch the breezy air;And I must think, do all I can,That there was pleasure there.If I these thoughts may not prevent,If such be of my creed the plan,Have I not reason to lamentWhat man has made of man?",
    "THE LAST OF THE FLOCK.": "In distant countries I have been,And yet I have not often seenA healthy man, a man full grownWeep in the public roads alone.But such a one, on English ground,And in the broad high-way, I met;Along the broad high-way he came,His cheeks with tears were wet.Sturdy he seemed, though he was sad;And in his arms a lamb he had.He saw me, and he turned aside,As if he wished himself to hide:Then with his coat he made essayTo wipe those briny tears away.I follow\u2019d him, and said, \u201cMy friend\u201cWhat ails you? wherefore weep you so?\u201d\u2014\u201cShame on me, Sir! this lusty lamb,He makes my tears to flow.To-day I fetched him from the rock;He is the last of all my flock.When I was young, a single man,And after youthful follies ran,Though little given to care and thought,Yet, so it was, a ewe I bought;And other sheep from her I raised,As healthy sheep as you might see,And then I married, and was richAs I could wish to be;Of sheep I number\u2019d a full score,And every year encreas\u2019d my store.Year after year my stock it grew,And from this one, this single ewe,Full fifty comely sheep I raised,As sweet a flock as ever grazed!Upon the mountain did they feed;They throve, and we at home did thrive.\u2014This lusty lamb of all my storeIs all that is alive:And now I care not if we die,And perish all of poverty.Ten children, Sir! had I to feed,Hard labour in a time of need!My pride was tamed, and in our grief,I of the parish ask\u2019d relief.They said I was a wealthy man;My sheep upon the mountain fed,And it was fit that thence I tookWhereof to buy us bread:\u201d\u201cDo this; how can we give to you,\u201dThey cried, \u201cwhat to the poor is due?\u201dI sold a sheep as they had said,And bought my little children bread,And they were healthy with their food;For me it never did me good.A woeful time it was for me,To see the end of all my gains,The pretty flock which I had rearedWith all my care and pains,To see it melt like snow away!For me it was a woeful day.Another still! and still another!A little lamb, and then its mother!It was a vein that never stopp\u2019d,Like blood-drops from my heart they dropp\u2019d.Till thirty were not left aliveThey dwindled, dwindled, one by one,And I may say that many a timeI wished they all were gone:They dwindled one by one away;For me it was a woeful day.To wicked deeds I was inclined,And wicked fancies cross\u2019d my mind,And every man I chanc\u2019d to see,I thought he knew some ill of meNo peace, no comfort could I find,No ease, within doors or without,And crazily, and wearily,I went my work about.Oft-times I thought to run away;For me it was a woeful day.Sir! \u2019twas a precious flock to me,As dear as my own children be;For daily with my growing storeI loved my children more and more.Alas! it was an evil time;God cursed me in my sore distress,I prayed, yet every day I thoughtI loved my children less;And every week, and every day,My flock, it seemed to melt away.They dwindled, Sir, sad sight to see!From ten to five, from five to three,A lamb, a weather, and a ewe;And then at last, from three to two;And of my fifty, yesterdayI had but only one,And here it lies upon my arm,Alas! and I have none;To-day I fetched it from the rock;It is the last of all my flock.\u201d",

    "THE MAD MOTHER.": "Her eyes are wild, her head is bare,The sun has burnt her coal-black hair,Her eye-brows have a rusty stain,And she came far from over the main.She has a baby on her arm,Or else she were alone;And underneath the hay-stack warm,And on the green-wood stone,She talked and sung the woods among;And it was in the English tongue.\u201cSweet babe! they say that I am mad,But nay, my heart is far too glad;And I am happy when I singFull many a sad and doleful thing:Then, lovely baby, do not fear!I pray thee have no fear of me,But, safe as in a cradle, hereMy lovely baby! thou shalt be,To thee I know too much I owe;I cannot work thee any woe.A fire was once within my brain;And in my head a dull, dull pain;And fiendish faces one, two, three,Hung at my breasts, and pulled at me.But then there came a sight of joy;It came at once to do me good;I waked, and saw my little boy,My little boy of flesh and blood;Oh joy for me that sight to see!For he was here, and only he.Suck, little babe, oh suck again!It cools my blood; it cools my brain;Thy lips I feel them, baby! theyDraw from my heart the pain away.Oh! press me with thy little hand;It loosens something at my chest;About that tight and deadly bandI feel thy little fingers press\u2019d.The breeze I see is in the tree;It comes to cool my babe and me.Oh! love me, love me, little boy!Thou art thy mother\u2019s only joy;And do not dread the waves below,When o\u2019er the sea-rock\u2019s edge we go;The high crag cannot work me harm,Nor leaping torrents when they howl;The babe I carry on my arm,He saves for me my precious soul;Then happy lie, for blest am I;Without me my sweet babe would die.Then do not fear, my boy! for theeBold as a lion I will be;And I will always be thy guide,Through hollow snows and rivers wide.I\u2019ll build an Indian bower; I knowThe leaves that make the softest bed:And if from me thou wilt not go,But still be true \u2019till I am dead,My pretty thing! then thou shalt sing,As merry as the birds in spring.Thy father cares not for my breast,\u2019Tis thine, sweet baby, there to rest:\u2019Tis all thine own! and if its hueBe changed, that was so fair to view,\u2019Tis fair enough for thee, my dove!My beauty, little child, is flown;But thou wilt live with me in love,And what if my poor cheek be brown?\u2019Tis well for me; thou canst not seeHow pale and wan it else would be.Dread not their taunts, my little life!I am thy father\u2019s wedded wife;And underneath the spreading treeWe two will live in honesty.If his sweet boy he could forsake,With me he never would have stay\u2019d:From him no harm my babe can take,But he, poor man! is wretched made,And every day we two will prayFor him that\u2019s gone and far away.I\u2019ll teach my boy the sweetest things;I\u2019ll teach him how the owlet sings.My little babe! thy lips are still,And thou hast almost suck\u2019d thy fill.\u2014Where art thou gone my own dear child?What wicked looks are those I see?Alas! alas! that look so wild,It never, never came from me:If thou art mad, my pretty lad,Then I must be for ever sad.Oh! smile on me, my little lamb!For I thy own dear mother am.My love for thee has well been tried:I\u2019ve sought thy father far and wide.I know the poisons of the shade,I know the earth-nuts fit for food;Then, pretty dear, be not afraid;We\u2019ll find thy father in the wood.Now laugh and be gay, to the woods away!And there, my babe; we\u2019ll live for aye.",
    "THE IDIOT BOY.": "Tis eight o\u2019clock,\u2014a clear March night,The moon is up\u2014the sky is blue,The owlet in the moonlight air,He shouts from nobody knows where;He lengthens out his lonely shout,Halloo! halloo! a long halloo!\u2014Why bustle thus about your door,What means this bustle, Betty Foy?Why are you in this mighty fret?And why on horseback have you setHim whom you love, your idiot boy?Beneath the moon that shines so bright,Till she is tired, let Betty FoyWith girt and stirrup fiddle-faddle;But wherefore set upon a saddleHim whom she loves, her idiot boy?There\u2019s scarce a soul that\u2019s out of bed;Good Betty! put him down again;His lips with joy they burr at you,But, Betty! what has he to doWith stirrup, saddle, or with rein?The world will say \u2019tis very idle,Bethink you of the time of night;There\u2019s not a mother, no not one,But when she hears what you have done,Oh! Betty she\u2019ll be in a fright.But Betty\u2019s bent on her intent,For her good neighbour, Susan Gale,Old Susan, she who dwells alone,Is sick, and makes a piteous moan,As if her very life would fail.There\u2019s not a house within a mile.No hand to help them in distress:Old Susan lies a bed in pain,And sorely puzzled are the twain,For what she ails they cannot guess.And Betty\u2019s husband\u2019s at the wood,Where by the week he doth abide,A woodman in the distant vale;There\u2019s none to help poor Susan Gale,What must be done? what will betide?And Betty from the lane has fetchedHer pony, that is mild and good,Whether he be in joy or pain,Feeding at will along the lane,Or bringing faggots from the wood.And he is all in travelling trim,And by the moonlight, Betty FoyHas up upon the saddle set,The like was never heard of yet,Him whom she loves, her idiot boy.And he must post without delayAcross the bridge that\u2019s in the dale,And by the church, and o\u2019er the down,To bring a doctor from the town,Or she will die, old Susan Gale.There is no need of boot or spur,There is no need of whip or wand,For Johnny has his holly-bough,And with a hurly-burly nowHe shakes the green bough in his hand.And Betty o\u2019er and o\u2019er has toldThe boy who is her best delight,Both what to follow, what to shun,What do, and what to leave undone,How turn to left, and how to right.And Betty\u2019s most especial charge,Was, \u201cJohnny! Johnny! mind that you\u201cCome home again, nor stop at all,\u201cCome home again, whate\u2019er befal,\u201cMy Johnny do, I pray you do.\u201dTo this did Johnny answer make,Both with his head, and with his hand,And proudly shook the bridle too,And then! his words were not a few,Which Betty well could understand.And now that Johnny is just going,Though Betty\u2019s in a mighty flurry,She gently pats the pony\u2019s side,On which her idiot boy must ride,And seems no longer in a hurry.But when the pony moved his legs,Oh! then for the poor idiot boy!For joy he cannot hold the bridle,For joy his head and heels are idle,He\u2019s idle all for very joy.And while the pony moves his legs,In Johnny\u2019s left-hand you may see,The green bough\u2019s motionless and dead;The moon that shines above his headIs not more still and mute than he.His heart it was so full of glee,That till full fifty yards were gone,He quite forgot his holly whip,And all his skill in horsemanship,Oh! happy, happy, happy John.And Betty\u2019s standing at the door,And Betty\u2019s face with joy o\u2019erflows,Proud of herself, and proud of him,She sees him in his travelling trim;How quietly her Johnny goes.The silence of her idiot boy,What hopes it sends to Betty\u2019s heart!He\u2019s at the guide-post\u2014he turns right,She watches till he\u2019s out of sight,And Betty will not then depart.Burr, burr\u2014now Johnny\u2019s lips they burr,As loud as any mill, or near it,Meek as a lamb the pony moves,And Johnny makes the noise he loves,And Betty listens, glad to hear it.Away she hies to Susan Gale:And Johnny\u2019s in a merry tune,The owlets hoot, the owlets curr,And Johnny\u2019s lips they burr, burr, burr,And on he goes beneath the moon.His steed and he right well agree,For of this pony there\u2019s a rumour,That should he lose his eyes and ears,And should he live a thousand years,He never will be out of humour.But then he is a horse that thinks!And when he thinks his pace is slack;Now, though he knows poor Johnny well,Yet for his life he cannot tellWhat he has got upon his back.So through the moonlight lanes they go,And far into the moonlight dale,And by the church, and o\u2019er the down,To bring a doctor from the town,To comfort poor old Susan Gale.And Betty, now at Susan\u2019s side,Is in the middle of her story,What comfort Johnny soon will bring,With many a most diverting thing,Of Johnny\u2019s wit and Johnny\u2019s glory.And Betty\u2019s still at Susan\u2019s side:By this time she\u2019s not quite so flurried;Demure with porringer and plateShe sits, as if in Susan\u2019s fateHer life and soul were buried.But Betty, poor good woman! she,You plainly in her face may read it,Could lend out of that moment\u2019s storeFive years of happiness or more,To any that might need it.But yet I guess that now and thenWith Betty all was not so well,And to the road she turns her ears,And thence full many a sound she hears,Which she to Susan will not tell.Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans,\u201cAs sure as there\u2019s a moon in heaven,\u201dCries Betty, \u201che\u2019ll be back again;\u201cThey\u2019ll both be here, \u2019tis almost ten,\u201cThey\u2019ll both be here before eleven.\u201dPoor Susan moans, poor Susan groans,The clock gives warning for eleven;\u2019Tis on the stroke\u2014\u201cIf Johnny\u2019s near,\u201dQuoth Betty \u201che will soon be here,\u201cAs sure as there\u2019s a moon in heaven.\u201dThe clock is on the stroke of twelve,And Johnny is not yet in sight,The moon\u2019s in heaven, as Betty sees,But Betty is not quite at ease;And Susan has a dreadful night.And Betty, half an hour ago,On Johnny vile reflections cast;\u201cA little idle sauntering thing!\u201dWith other names, an endless string,But now that time is gone and past.And Betty\u2019s drooping at the heart,That happy time all past and gone,\u201cHow can it be he is so late?\u201cThe doctor he has made him wait,\u201cSusan! they\u2019ll both be here anon.\u201dAnd Susan\u2019s growing worse and worse,And Betty\u2019s in a sad quandary;And then there\u2019s nobody to sayIf she must go or she must stay:\u2014She\u2019s in a sad quandary.The clock is on the stroke of one;But neither Doctor nor his guideAppear along the moonlight road,There\u2019s neither horse nor man abroad,And Betty\u2019s still at Susan\u2019s side.And Susan she begins to fearOf sad mischances not a few,That Johnny may perhaps be drown\u2019d,Or lost perhaps, and never found;Which they must both for ever rue.She prefaced half a hint of thisWith, \u201cGod forbid it should be true!\u201dAt the first word that Susan saidCried Betty, rising from the bed,\u201cSusan, I\u2019d gladly stay with you.\u201cI must be gone, I must away,\u201cConsider, Johnny\u2019s but half-wise;\u201cSusan, we must take care of him,\u201cIf he is hurt in life or limb\u201d\u2014\u201cOh God forbid!\u201d poor Susan cries.\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d says Betty, going,\u201cWhat can I do to ease your pain?\u201cGood Susan tell me, and I\u2019ll stay;\u201cI fear you\u2019re in a dreadful way,\u201cBut I shall soon be back again.\u201d\u201cGood Betty go, good Betty go,\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that can ease my pain.\u201dThen off she hies, but with a prayerThat God poor Susan\u2019s life would spare,Till she comes back again.So, through the moonlight lane she goes,And far into the moonlight dale;And how she ran, and how she walked,And all that to herself she talked,Would surely be a tedious tale.In high and low, above, below,In great and small, in round and square,In tree and tower was Johnny seen,In bush and brake, in black and green,\u2019Twas Johnny, Johnny, every where.She\u2019s past the bridge that\u2019s in the dale,And now the thought torments her sore,Johnny perhaps his horse forsook,To hunt the moon that\u2019s in the brook,And never will be heard of more.And now she\u2019s high upon the down,Alone amid a prospect wide;There\u2019s neither Johnny nor his horse,Among the fern or in the gorse;There\u2019s neither doctor nor his guide.\u201cOh saints! what is become of him?\u201cPerhaps he\u2019s climbed into an oak,\u201cWhere he will stay till he is dead;\u201cOr sadly he has been misled,\u201cAnd joined the wandering gypsey-folk.\u201cOr him that wicked pony\u2019s carried\u201cTo the dark cave, the goblins\u2019 hall,\u201cOr in the castle he\u2019s pursuing,\u201cAmong the ghosts, his own undoing;\u201cOr playing with the waterfall.\u201dAt poor old Susan then she railed,While to the town she posts away;\u201cIf Susan had not been so ill,\u201cAlas! I should have had him still,\u201cMy Johnny, till my dying day.\u201dPoor Betty! in this sad distemper,The doctor\u2019s self would hardly spare,Unworthy things she talked and wild,Even he, of cattle the most mild,The pony had his share.And now she\u2019s got into the town,And to the doctor\u2019s door she hies;Tis silence all on every side;The town so long, the town so wide,Is silent as the skies.And now she\u2019s at the doctor\u2019s door,She lifts the knocker, rap, rap, rap,The doctor at the casement shews,His glimmering eyes that peep and doze;And one hand rubs his old night-cap.\u201cOh Doctor! Doctor! where\u2019s my Johnny?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here, what is\u2019t you want with me?\u201d\u201cOh Sir! you know I\u2019m Betty Foy,\u201cAnd I have lost my poor dear boy,\u201cYou know him\u2014him you often see;\u201cHe\u2019s not so wise as some folks be,\u201d\u201cThe devil take his wisdom!\u201d saidThe Doctor, looking somewhat grim,\u201cWhat, woman! should I know of him?\u201dAnd, grumbling, he went back to bed.\u201cO woe is me! O woe is me!\u201cHere will I die; here will I die;\u201cI thought to find my Johnny here,\u201cBut he is neither far nor near,\u201cOh! what a wretched mother I!\u201dShe stops, she stands, she looks about,Which way to turn she cannot tell.Poor Betty! it would ease her painIf she had heart to knock again;\u2014The clock strikes three\u2014a dismal knell!Then up along the town she hies,No wonder if her senses fail,This piteous news so much it shock\u2019d her,She quite forgot to send the Doctor,To comfort poor old Susan Gale.And now she\u2019s high upon the down,And she can see a mile of road,\u201cOh cruel! I\u2019m almost three-score;\u201cSuch night as this was ne\u2019er before,\u201cThere\u2019s not a single soul abroad.\u201dShe listens, but she cannot hearThe foot of horse, the voice of man;The streams with softest sound are flowing,The grass you almost hear it growing,You hear it now if e\u2019er you can.The owlets through the long blue nightAre shouting to each other still:Fond lovers, yet not quite hob nob,They lengthen out the tremulous sob,That echoes far from hill to hill.Poor Betty now has lost all hope,Her thoughts are bent on deadly sin;A green-grown pond she just has pass\u2019d,And from the brink she hurries fast,Lest she should drown herself therein.And now she sits her down and weeps;Such tears she never shed before;\u201cOh dear, dear pony! my sweet joy!\u201cOh carry back my idiot boy!\u201cAnd we will ne\u2019er o\u2019erload thee more.\u201dA thought is come into her head;\u201cThe pony he is mild and good,\u201cAnd we have always used him well;\u201cPerhaps he\u2019s gone along the dell,\u201cAnd carried Johnny to the wood.\u201dThen up she springs as if on wings;She thinks no more of deadly sin;If Betty fifty ponds should see,The last of all her thoughts would be,To drown herself therein.Oh reader! now that I might tellWhat Johnny and his horse are doing!What they\u2019ve been doing all this time,Oh could I put it into rhyme,A most delightful tale pursuing!Perhaps, and no unlikely thought!He with his pony now doth roamThe cliffs and peaks so high that are,To lay his hands upon a star,And in his pocket bring it home.Perhaps he\u2019s turned himself about,His face unto his horse\u2019s tail,And still and mute, in wonder lost,All like a silent horseman-ghost,He travels on along the vale.And now, perhaps, he\u2019s hunting sheep,A fierce and dreadful hunter he!Yon valley, that\u2019s so trim and green,In five months\u2019 time, should he be seen,A desart wilderness will be.Perhaps, with head and heels on fire,And like the very soul of evil,He\u2019s galloping away, away,And so he\u2019ll gallop on for aye,The bane of all that dread the devil.I to the muses have been bound,These fourteen years, by strong indentures;Oh gentle muses! let me tellBut half of what to him befel,For sure he met with strange adventures.Oh gentle muses! is this kind?Why will ye thus my suit repel?Why of your further aid bereave me?And can ye thus unfriended leave me?Ye muses! whom I love so well.Who\u2019s yon, that, near the waterfall,Which thunders down with headlong force,Beneath the moon, yet shining fair,As careless as if nothing were,Sits upright on a feeding horse?Unto his horse, that\u2019s feeding free,He seems, I think, the rein to give;Of moon or stars he takes no heed;Of such we in romances read,\u2014\u2019Tis Johnny! Johnny! as I live.And that\u2019s the very pony too.Where is she, where is Betty Foy?She hardly can sustain her fears;The roaring water-fall she hears,And cannot find her idiot boy.Your pony\u2019s worth his weight in gold,Then calm your terrors, Betty Foy!She\u2019s coming from among the trees,And now, all full in view, she seesHim whom she loves, her idiot boy.And Betty sees the pony too:Why stand you thus Good Betty Foy?It is no goblin, \u2019tis no ghost,\u2019Tis he whom you so long have lost,He whom you love, your idiot boy.She looks again\u2014her arms are up\u2014She screams\u2014she cannot move for joy;She darts as with a torrent\u2019s force,She almost has o\u2019erturned the horse,And fast she holds her idiot boy.And Johnny burrs and laughs aloud,Whether in cunning or in joy,I cannot tell; but while he laughs,Betty a drunken pleasure quaffs,To hear again her idiot boy.And now she\u2019s at the pony\u2019s tail,And now she\u2019s at the pony\u2019s head,On that side now, and now on this,And almost stifled with her bliss,A few sad tears does Betty shed.She kisses o\u2019er and o\u2019er again,Him whom she loves, her idiot boy,She\u2019s happy here, she\u2019s happy there,She is uneasy every where;Her limbs are all alive with joy.She pats the pony, where or whenShe knows not, happy Betty Foy!The little pony glad may be,But he is milder far than she,You hardly can perceive his joy.\u201cOh! Johnny, never mind the Doctor;\u201cYou\u2019ve done your best, and that is all.\u201dShe took the reins, when this was said,And gently turned the pony\u2019s headFrom the loud water-fall.By this the stars were almost gone,The moon was setting on the hill,So pale you scarcely looked at her:The little birds began to stir,Though yet their tongues were still.The pony, Betty, and her boy,Wind slowly through the woody dale:And who is she, be-times abroad,That hobbles up the steep rough road?Who is it, but old Susan Gale?Long Susan lay deep lost in thought,And many dreadful fears beset her,Both for her messenger and nurse;And as her mind grew worse and worse,Her body it grew better.She turned, she toss\u2019d herself in bed,On all sides doubts and terrors met her;Point after point did she discuss;And while her mind was fighting thus,Her body still grew better.\u201cAlas! what is become of them?\u201cThese fears can never be endured,\u201cI\u2019ll to the wood.\u201d\u2014The word scarce said,Did Susan rise up from her bed,As if by magic cured.Away she posts up hill and down,And to the wood at length is come,She spies her friends, she shouts a greeting;Oh me! it is a merry meeting,As ever was in Christendom.The owls have hardly sung their last,While our four travellers homeward wend;The owls have hooted all night long,And with the owls began my song,And with the owls must end.For while they all were travelling home,Cried Betty, \u201cTell us Johnny, do,\u201cWhere all this long night you have been,\u201cWhat you have heard, what you have seen,\u201cAnd Johnny, mind you tell us true.\u201dNow Johnny all night long had heardThe owls in tuneful concert strive;No doubt too he the moon had seen;For in the moonlight he had beenFrom eight o\u2019clock till five.And thus to Betty\u2019s question, heMade answer, like a traveller bold,(His very words I give to you,)\u201cThe cocks did crow to-whoo, to-whoo,\u201cAnd the sun did shine so cold.\u201d\u2014Thus answered Johnny in his glory,And that was all his travel\u2019s story.",

    "THE COMPLAINT OF A FORSAKEN INDIAN WOMAN": "[When a Northern Indian, from sickness, is unable to continue his journey with his companions; he is left behind, covered over with Deer-skins, and is supplied with water, food, and fuel if the situation of the place will afford it. He is informed of the track which his companions intend to pursue, and if he is unable to follow, or overtake them, he perishes alone in the Desart; unless he should have the good fortune to fall in with some other Tribes of Indians. It is unnecessary to add that the females are equally, or still more, exposed to the same fate. See that very interesting work,Hearne\u2019s Journey from Hudson\u2019s Bay to the Northern Ocean. When the Northern Lights, as the same writer informs us, vary their position in the air, they make a rustling and a crackling noise. This circumstance is alluded to in the first stanza of the following poem.] Before I see another day,Oh let my body die away!In sleep I heard the northern gleams;The stars they were among my dreams;In sleep did I behold the skies,I saw the crackling flashes drive;And yet they are upon my eyes,And yet I am alive.Before I see another day,Oh let my body die away!My fire is dead: it knew no pain;Yet is it dead, and I remain.All stiff with ice the ashes lie;And they are dead, and I will die.When I was well, I wished to live,For clothes, for warmth, for food, and fire;But they to me no joy can give,No pleasure now, and no desire.Then here contented will I lie;Alone I cannot fear to die.Alas! you might have dragged me onAnother day, a single one!Too soon despair o\u2019er me prevailed;Too soon my heartless spirit failed;When you were gone my limbs were stronger,And Oh how grievously I rue,That, afterwards, a little longer,My friends, I did not follow you!For strong and without pain I lay,My friends, when you were gone away.My child! they gave thee to another,A woman who was not thy mother.When from my arms my babe they took,On me how strangely did he look!Through his whole body something ran,A most strange something did I see;\u2014As if he strove to be a man,That he might pull the sledge for me.And then he stretched his arms, how wild!Oh mercy! like a little child.My little joy! my little pride!In two days more I must have died.Then do not weep and grieve for me;I feel I must have died with thee.Oh wind that o\u2019er my head art flying,The way my friends their course did bend,I should not feel the pain of dying,Could I with thee a message send.Too soon, my friends, you went away;For I had many things to say.I\u2019ll follow you across the snow,You travel heavily and slow:In spite of all my weary pain,I\u2019ll look upon your tents again.My fire is dead, and snowy whiteThe water which beside it stood;The wolf has come to me to-night,And he has stolen away my food.For ever left alone am I,Then wherefore should I fear to die?My journey will be shortly run,I shall not see another sun,I cannot lift my limbs to knowIf they have any life or no.My poor forsaken child! if IFor once could have thee close to me,With happy heart I then would die,And my last thoughts would happy be,I feel my body die away,I shall not see another day.",
    "THE CONVICT.": "The glory of evening was spread through the west;\u2014On the slope of a mountain I stood;While the joy that precedes the calm season of restRang loud through the meadow and wood.\u201cAnd must we then part from a dwelling so fair?\u201dIn the pain of my spirit I said,And with a deep sadness I turned, to repairTo the cell where the convict is laid.The thick-ribbed walls that o\u2019ershadow the gateResound; and the dungeons unfold:I pause; and at length, through the glimmering grate,That outcast of pity behold.His black matted head on his shoulder is bent,And deep is the sigh of his breath,And with stedfast dejection his eyes are intentOn the fetters that link him to death.\u2019Tis sorrow enough on that visage to gaze.That body dismiss\u2019d from his care;Yet my fancy has pierced to his heart, and pourtraysMore terrible images there.His bones are consumed, and his life-blood is dried,With wishes the past to undo;And his crime, through the pains that o\u2019erwhelm him, descried,Still blackens and grows on his view.When from the dark synod, or blood-reeking field,To his chamber the monarch is led,All soothers of sense their soft virtue shall yield,And quietness pillow his head.But if grief, self-consumed, in oblivion would doze,And conscience her tortures appease,\u2019Mid tumult and uproar this man must repose;In the comfortless vault of disease.When his fetters at night have so press\u2019d on his limbs,That the weight can no longer be borne,If, while a half-slumber his memory bedims,The wretch on his pallet should turn,While the jail-mastiff howls at the dull clanking chain,From the roots of his hair there shall startA thousand sharp punctures of cold-sweating pain,And terror shall leap at his heart.But now he half-raises his deep-sunken eye,And the motion unsettles a tear;The silence of sorrow it seems to supply,And asks of me why I am here.\u201cPoor victim! no idle intruder has stood\u201cWith o\u2019erweening complacence our state to compare,\u201cBut one, whose first wish is the wish to be good,\u201cIs come as a brother thy sorrows to share.\u201cAt thy name though compassion her nature resign,\u201cThough in virtue\u2019s proud mouth thy report be a stain,\u201cMy care, if the arm of the mighty were mine,\u201cWould plant thee where yet thou might\u2019st blossom again.\u201d",
    "LINES WRITTEN A FEW MILES ABOVE TINTERN ABBEY, ON REVISITING THE BANKS OF THE WYE DURING A TOUR, JULY 13, 1798.": "Five years have passed; five summers, with the lengthOf five long winters! and again I hearThese waters, rolling from their mountain-springsWith a sweet inland murmur.4\u2014Once againDo I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,Which on a wild secluded scene impressThoughts of more deep seclusion; and connectThe landscape with the quiet of the sky.The day is come when I again reposeHere, under this dark sycamore, and viewThese plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,Which, at this season, with their unripe fruits,Among the woods and copses lose themselves,Nor, with their green and simple hue, disturbThe wild green landscape. Once again I seeThese hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little linesOf sportive wood run wild; these pastoral farmsGreen to the very door; and wreathes of smokeSent up, in silence, from among the trees,With some uncertain notice, as might seem,Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,Or of some hermit\u2019s cave, where by his fireThe hermit sits alone.Though absent long,These forms of beauty have not been to me,As is a landscape to a blind man\u2019s eye:But oft, in lonely rooms, and mid the dinOf towns and cities, I have owed to them,In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart,And passing even into my purer mindWith tranquil restoration:\u2014feelings tooOf unremembered pleasure; such, perhaps,As may have had no trivial influenceOn that best portion of a good man\u2019s life;His little, nameless, unremembered actsOf kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,To them I may have owed another gift,Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,In which the burthen of the mystery,In which the heavy and the weary weightOf all this unintelligible worldIs lighten\u2019d:\u2014that serene and blessed mood,In which the affections gently lead us on,Until, the breath of this corporeal frame,And even the motion of our human bloodAlmost suspended, we are laid asleepIn body, and become a living soul:While with an eye made quiet by the powerOf harmony, and the deep power of joy,We see into the life of things.If thisBe but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft,In darkness, and amid the many shapesOf joyless day-light; when the fretful stirUnprofitable, and the fever of the world,Have hung upon the beatings of my heart,How oft, in spirit, have I turned to theeO sylvan Wye! Thou wanderer through the woods,How often has my spirit turned to thee!And now, with gleams of half-extinguish\u2019d thought,With many recognitions dim and faint,And somewhat of a sad perplexity,The picture of the mind revives again:While here I stand, not only with the senseOf present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughtsThat in this moment there is life and foodFor future years. And so I dare to hopeThough changed, no doubt, from what I was, when firstI came among these hills; when like a roeI bounded o\u2019er the mountains, by the sidesOf the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,Wherever nature led; more like a manFlying from something that he dreads, than oneWho sought the thing he loved. For nature then(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,And their glad animal movements all gone by,)To me was all in all.\u2014I cannot paintWhat then I was. The sounding cataractHaunted me like a passion: the tall rock,The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,Their colours and their forms, were then to meAn appetite: a feeling and a love,That had no need of a remoter charm,By thought supplied, or any interestUnborrowed from the eye.\u2014That time is past,And all its aching joys are now no more,And all its dizzy raptures. Not for thisFaint I, nor mourn nor murmur: other giftsHave followed, for such loss, I would believe,Abundant recompence. For I have learnedTo look on nature, not as in the hourOf thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimesThe still, sad music of humanity,Not harsh nor grating, though of ample powerTo chasten and subdue. And I have feltA presence that disturbs me with the joyOf elevated thoughts; a sense sublimeOf something far more deeply interfused,Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,And the round ocean, and the living air,And the blue sky, and in the mind of man,A motion and a spirit, that impelsAll thinking things, all objects of all thought,And rolls through all things. Therefore am I stillA lover of the meadows and the woods,And mountains; and of all that we beholdFrom this green earth; of all the mighty worldOf eye and ear, both what they half-create,5And what perceive; well pleased to recognizeIn nature and the language of the sense,The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soulOf all my moral being.Nor, perchance,If I were not thus taught, should I the moreSuffer my genial spirits to decay:For thou art with me, here, upon the banksOf this fair river; thou, my dearest Friend,My dear, dear Friend, and in thy voice I catchThe language of my former heart, and readMy former pleasures in the shooting lightsOf thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little whileMay I behold in thee what I was once,My dear, dear Sister! And this prayer I make,Knowing that Nature never did betrayThe heart that loved her; \u2019tis her privilege,Through all the years of this our life, to leadFrom joy to joy: for she can so informThe mind that is within us, so impressWith quietness and beauty, and so feedWith lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor allThe dreary intercourse of daily life,Shall e\u2019er prevail against us, or disturbOur chearful faith that all which we beholdIs full of blessings. Therefore let the moonShine on thee in thy solitary walk;And let the misty mountain winds be freeTo blow against thee: and in after years,When these wild ecstasies shall be maturedInto a sober pleasure, when thy mindShall be a mansion for all lovely forms,Thy memory be as a dwelling-placeFor all sweet sounds and harmonies; Oh! then,If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughtsOf tender joy wilt thou remember me,And these my exhortations! Nor, perchance,If I should be, where I no more can hearThy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleamsOf past existence, wilt thou then forgetThat on the banks of this delightful streamWe stood together; and that I, so longA worshipper of Nature, hither came,Unwearied in that service: rather sayWith warmer love, oh! with far deeper zealOf holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,That after many wanderings, many yearsOf absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,And this green pastoral landscape, were to meMore dear, both for themselves, and for thy sake.

Footnote 5(return): This line has a close resemblance to an admirable line of Young, the exact expression of which I cannot recollect."
