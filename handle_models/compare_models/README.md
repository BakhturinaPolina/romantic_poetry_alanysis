# Description
Get top words from each model, get `most_similar` for each of them, and compare them between the three models.

# To run
* Install deps: `pip install gensim spacy`
* Place the models into this folder.
* `python3 generate_model_vector_map.py`

# Example
* This particular code is not model-agnostic, it expects our models.
* `top_words_most_similar.json` is included as sample output.
