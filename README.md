# Description

This is all the code that was used for my Romantic Poetry analysis project. It includes the following:

* `/collect_data` has the code which is parsing text from different sources.
* `/process_data` has the code which filters and preprocesses the text previously extracted.
* `/handle_models` has the code that has to do with training and using our models.

Each script is contained in its own folder, which has a separate `README.md`.
